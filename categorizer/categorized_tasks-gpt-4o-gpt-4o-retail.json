    "reason": "The conversation involves both procedural and declarative elements. \n\nProcedural: The user is engaging in a step-by-step process to return items from an order. The assistant follows the user's instructions to authenticate the user, locate the order, and process the return. This involves a series of actions that are procedural in nature, such as confirming the items to be returned and the refund method.\n\nDeclarative: The user is also seeking information about their order and the return process. The assistant provides information about the order details and confirms the items and refund method, which involves declarative elements as the assistant is providing information and confirming details based on the user's requests."

    "reason": "The conversation involves multiple tasks: MODIFY_ADDRESS, MODIFY_ORDER, and EXCHANGE_ORDER. \n\n1. MODIFY_ADDRESS: The user requests to update the shipping address for an order and also to update the default user address. This involves procedural steps where the assistant follows the user's instructions to update the address, making it procedural.\n\n2. SHOW_INFO: The user asks for the order ID, which is a request for information. The assistant provides the order ID and current address details, making this part declarative.\n\n3. EXCHANGE_ORDER: The user expresses a desire to exchange a tablet for a cheaper model. The assistant provides information about available models and price differences, which is declarative. However, the exchange process itself involves procedural steps, but it cannot be completed due to the order status, so it remains partially procedural.\n\nOverall, the conversation is both procedural and declarative due to the combination of information requests and procedural actions taken by the assistant."

    "reason": "The conversation involves multiple tasks: MODIFY_ADDRESS, EXCHANGE_ORDER, and MODIFY_ORDER. \n\n1. MODIFY_ADDRESS: The user wants to update the address for an order. This task is procedural as it involves a step-by-step process where the assistant follows the user's instructions to attempt to update the address. However, it also involves declarative elements as the assistant provides information about the current address and the inability to update without new details.\n\n2. EXCHANGE_ORDER: The user requests to exchange a tablet for a more affordable one. This task is procedural because it involves a series of steps to identify the new item and confirm the exchange. The assistant follows the user's instructions to proceed with the exchange.\n\n3. MODIFY_ORDER: When the exchange cannot be processed due to the order's pending status, the user requests to modify the order instead. This task is procedural as it involves changing the order details based on the user's instructions.\n\nOverall, the conversation is both procedural and declarative because it involves step-by-step actions (procedural) and information exchange (declarative)."

This is procedural as the user specifies the changes, and the assistant follows through with the modifications.\n\n2. MODIFY_ADDRESS: The user requests an update to the shipping address for the laptop order. This is procedural as the user provides the new address, and the assistant updates it accordingly.\n\n3. EXCHANGE_ORDER: The user requests to exchange a watch for one with a black dial. This is procedural as the user specifies the desired change, and the assistant checks availability and provides options.\n\nThe conversation is both procedural and declarative because it involves procedural steps for modifying orders and addresses, and declarative elements where the assistant provides information about the order status, availability of items, and refund details."

The assistant follows a step-by-step process to authenticate the user, identify the pending orders, and confirm the cancellation. This task is procedural as it involves a sequence of actions that the assistant performs based on the user's instructions.\n\n2. SHOW_INFO: The assistant provides information about the pending orders, including order IDs, items, and total amounts. This task is declarative as it involves the assistant retrieving and presenting information to the user.\n\nSince the conversation involves both procedural actions (cancelling orders) and declarative actions (providing order information), it is categorized as both procedural and declarative."
