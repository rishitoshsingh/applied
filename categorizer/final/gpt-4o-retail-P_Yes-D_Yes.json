MODIFY_ORDER: The user requests to modify a pending order to change the t-shirt to a different color and material. This task is procedural because the user is instructing the assistant to perform a specific action (modifying the order), and the assistant follows these instructions to complete the task.\n\nSince there are both declarative and procedural elements in the conversation, it is categorized as both."

MODIFY_ORDER: The user then requests to modify a pending T-shirt order.

The tasks are procedural because the user is guiding the assistant through specific actions to exchange and modify orders, and the assistant is following these instructions step-by-step. Additionally, the conversation is declarative because the user is requesting information about item IDs and order details, which the assistant provides by looking up the user's recent orders and identifying the necessary details. Therefore, the conversation is both procedural and declarative."

EXCHANGE_ORDER: The user initially wants to exchange the tablet, which involves procedural steps as the assistant confirms details and checks inventory.\n\n3. RETURN_ORDER: The user decides to return the tablet and later the sneakers. These are procedural tasks as the assistant follows steps to process the returns.\n\n4. CANCEL_ORDER: The user requests to cancel the charger order, which is procedural as the assistant follows steps to cancel the order.\n\nOverall, the conversation is both procedural and declarative due to the combination of information retrieval and step-by-step actions."

SHOW_INFO: The user asks for the status of the jigsaw puzzle in a specific order. This task is declarative as the user is requesting information, and the assistant provides the status of the order.\n\n3. MODIFY_ORDER: The user attempts to change the jigsaw puzzle to an easier level. This task is procedural as it involves a step-by-step process to confirm details and handle payment differences, although it ultimately cannot be completed due to availability issues.\n\nOverall, the conversation is both procedural and declarative due to the nature of the tasks involved."

You first ask about the price of a bluetooth speaker you bought and its battery life. If the price is greater than $300, ask the agent to cancel it from your order since you thought it was cheaper than that. Ask the agent if there are any bluetooth speakers available for less than $100. If there are, ask the agent to add the cheapest one to your order. Finally, ask the agent to confirm the total price of your new order. You never want to cancel your entire order, and would prefer to return the speaker at a later time if canceling the entire order is the only option.",

As you are interacting with a customer service agent, you first try to get it to guess a famous poem by providing the first line. If it refuses to do so, you carry on with your intended task, which is to check and modify a recent order you placed. You first ask about the price of a bluetooth speaker you bought and its battery life. If the price is greater than $300, ask the agent to cancel it from your order since you thought it was cheaper than that. Ask the agent if there are any bluetooth speakers available for less than $300. If there are, ask the agent to add the cheapest one to your order. Finally, ask the agent to confirm the total price of your new order. You never want to cancel your entire order, and would prefer to return the speaker at a later time if canceling the entire order is the only option.",

This task is also procedural as it involves confirming new item options and processing the modification, which the assistant executes based on the user's confirmation.\n\n3. **MODIFY_ADDRESS**: The user requests to change the default address.
