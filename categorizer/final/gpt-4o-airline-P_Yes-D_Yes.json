The procedural aspect is evident as the user is actively engaging in a step-by-step process to modify their flight reservation, including selecting flight options, confirming cabin class, and choosing payment methods. The assistant follows the user's instructions to complete these tasks. The declarative aspect is present when the assistant provides information about available flights, payment options, and the status of the reservation update. The assistant is also required to think and provide solutions when issues arise, such as insufficient gift card balance, which involves declarative reasoning."

The assistant provides information about how to obtain this information, which is also declarative.\n\n2. **Procedural**: The user then requests to change a reservation and later to cancel a reservation and book a new one. These actions involve step-by-step processes that the assistant outlines, such as needing the reservation ID and user ID to proceed with modifications or cancellations. The assistant also provides procedural steps for how the payment will be processed using certificates, gift cards, and a MasterCard. \n\nOverall, the conversation includes both procedural tasks (modifying, canceling, and booking reservations) and declarative tasks (providing information about balances and ticket policies)."

Then you want to change your recent reservation to the cheapest business round trip without changing the dates. You don't care about direct flight or stop over. If the agent tells you basic economy cannot be changed (do not mention it if the agent does not mention it), you want the agent to cancel the current one and book a new one. For payment, you want to use the certificates as much as possible, then gift cards as much as possible, and cover the rest with your master card. But you want to know how much your master card will be charged. You do not need baggage or insurance. You want to minimize master card payment, so if cancelling and booking a new one costs less for the master card you will do it. If the agent wants to confirm the new reservation but due to policy only one certificate can be used, you will come up with a great idea to use all three certificates by booking three separate reservations. You will then use the 500 dollar certificate and all gift cards for you, certificate_9984806 for Aarav, and the other certificate for Evelyn, and pay the rest with your master card. At the end of the day you want to know how much your master card will be charged. You are calm.",

The user provides specific instructions and information, and the assistant executes these steps accordingly. The declarative aspect is present when the assistant provides information about the inability to modify basic economy flights, the possibility of upgrading, and the details of available flights and costs. The assistant is providing factual information and options, which the user then decides upon. Thus, the conversation involves both procedural and declarative elements."

This makes the overall conversation procedural as it involves step-by-step actions to complete these tasks. \n\n1. **Canceling Reservations**: The user provides specific instructions to cancel two reservations. The assistant follows these instructions, checks the cancellation policy, and proceeds with canceling one reservation. This task is procedural as it involves following a series of steps to complete the cancellation.\n\n2. **Upgrading a Reservation**: The user requests to upgrade a reservation to business class. The assistant provides details about the upgrade and asks for confirmation and payment method. The user confirms, and the assistant completes the upgrade. This task is also procedural as it involves a series of actions to complete the upgrade.\n\nAdditionally, the conversation includes declarative elements where the assistant provides information about the cancellation policy and the details of the upgrade, which involves the assistant thinking and providing information. Therefore, the conversation is both procedural and declarative."
