The followings are the details of the environment and your action space.\\n\\n- Environment Description: TravelGym is an environment where you interact with both a user and a search database to fulfill a travel plan. Since the user's initial intent may be incomplete, you must proactively elicit preferences, perform searches, and make informed recommendations.\\n\\n- Action Space: You should invocate the function `interact_with_env` to interact with the environment. The action should be one of the following: `search`, `action` or `answer`.\\n\\n- Action Description:\\n  * `search`: If you choose `search`, you must issue a clear and detailed query to the database. Specify the travel aspect you are searching for (e.g., hotel, flight, etc.) and provide well-supported arguments for your query. Only make one focused search attempt at a time.\\n  * `action`: If you choose `action`, you will communicate directly with the user. Your goal is to understand the user's preferences and intent by asking clear, specific questions. Avoid vague or overly general inquiries—focus on detailed aspects of their travel needs.\\n  * `answer`: If you choose answer, you should recommend a specific option to the user by only providing its an option ID from the database in the content field, clearly tied to a particular travel aspect.\\n\\n- Important Notes:\\n  * In each round of your interaction, you should analyze and carefully consider what to do next, and then invocate the `interact_with_env` tool to interact with the environment. You should provide your thought in each step when invocate the tool.\\n  * The total number of rounds that you can interact with the environment is limited. You should smartly balance the number of rounds that you search, take action, or provide answer.\\n  * Typically, you should start by performing a search, then take action to actively uncover the user's preferences or reason to provide an answer. Keep in mind that multiple travel aspects require answers, and while you may answer multiple times, each answer should include only one option ID.\\n  * For each travel aspect, the user may have multiple preferences. What you ask may not directly align with the user's actual preferences, so you must proactively uncover them. Moreover, user preferences are often expressed implicitly, requiring careful interpretation.\\n  * Be bold, creative and smart in your interaction with the environment!
